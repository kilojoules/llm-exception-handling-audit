# --- Uncertainty Propagation ---

# For simplicity, we'll assume a normal distribution for wind speed
# and direction and propagate it through the wake model.

# --- Sobol Sensitivity Analysis ---
# This is a placeholder. You'll need a library like 'SALib'

# Here's a simplified version to illustrate the concept:

# 1.  Calculate the mean and variance of WS_eff
ws_eff_values = np.array([res.WS_eff.values for res in all_sim_res])
ws_eff_mean = np.mean(ws_eff_values, axis=0)
ws_eff_variance = np.var(ws_eff_values, axis=0)

# 2.  Approximate first-order Sobol indices (simplified)
#     In reality, SALib or a similar library would do this rigorously.

for t_idx in time_step_indices:
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
    
    # Get the wind speed and direction for this time step
    ws_t = ws[t_idx]
    wd_t = wd[t_idx]
    
    # Calculate the flow map
    flow_map = all_sim_res[0].flow_map(wd=wd_t, ws=ws_t)  # Use the first simulation for the base flow
    flow_map.plot_wake_map()
    
    # Overlay Sobol sensitivity (this is a simplification)
    #  -  The 'sobol_first_order' needs to be reshaped or handled
    #     appropriately to match the flow_map grid.
    #  -  This is just a conceptual visualization; adapt as needed.
    
    plt.contourf(flow_map.X, flow_map.Y, sobol_first_order[0, ..., t_idx], alpha=0.2, cmap='viridis')  # Example

Explanation:

    Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries (numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, xarray) and PyWake modules.

    Install PyWake: Install PyWake if it's not already installed.

    Define Site and Wind Turbine: Create instances of Hornsrev1Site and V80 wind turbine.   

Wind Farm Model: Initialize the wind farm model (Bastankhah_PorteAgel_2014).  

Uncertainty Propagation (Placeholder):

    This section simulates uncertainty. You must replace this with your actual uncertainty propagation method.
    It generates n_simulations of wind speed (ws) and wind direction (wd) samples, assuming a normal distribution. You should adjust the distributions (ws_std, wd_std) to match your real-world measurement uncertainties.
    It runs the wind farm model for each set of samples and stores the results.

Sobol Sensitivity Analysis (Placeholder):

    This is also a placeholder. A proper Sobol analysis requires a library like SALib.
    The code calculates a simplified approximation of the first-order Sobol indices for WS_eff.
    You will need to implement the full Sobol method using SALib or a similar tool. This involves generating sample matrices, running the model, and calculating the Sobol indices based on the variance decomposition.

Plotting:

    It selects a few time steps to visualize the flow.
    For each time step:
        It creates a flow map using one of the simulation results.   

            It attempts to overlay a contour plot of the Sobol sensitivity. This is where you'll need to adapt the code significantly to correctly display the Sobol indices on the flow map grid. The sobol_first_order data needs to be reshaped and interpolated to match the flow_map.X and flow_map.Y grids.
            It saves each plot as a PNG file.

Important Notes:

    Sobol Sensitivity: The Sobol sensitivity analysis is crucial. You must replace the placeholder with a proper implementation using a library like SALib. This will involve:
        Generating Sobol sample matrices.
        Running the PyWake model for each sample.
        Calculating the Sobol indices (first-order, total-order, etc.) from the results.
    Uncertainty: The uncertainty propagation is simplified. Use your actual measurement uncertainty data and propagation methods.
    Plotting Sobol Indices: The code for overlaying the Sobol indices on the flow map is a starting point. You'll need to handle the grid differences and potentially interpolate the Sobol indices for proper visualization.
    Time Series: The code assumes you have time series data (wd, ws, time_stamp). If your uncertainty varies with time, you'll need to incorporate that into the uncertainty propagation.
