The crash you're seeing during the final HDF5 merging (`OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found)`) is caused by a corrupted or invalid worker HDF5 file ‚Äî likely one of the 0-byte files like `worker_61817.h5`. This breaks `h5py.File(..., 'r')`, which assumes a valid HDF5 signature at the file header.

To make your pipeline **robust and able to fail gracefully**, you can modify your merging script to:

1. **Check each worker file's validity before opening it**.
2. **Skip or log bad files**, and optionally **abort the merge process early**.
3. **Cleanly terminate with an informative error message**.

### ‚úÖ Suggested Fix in Python (to use in your `main()` or merging loop)

Here‚Äôs a reliable pattern to catch this:

```python
import h5py
import os

def is_valid_hdf5(filepath):
    """Quick check for HDF5 signature without opening via h5py."""
    try:
        if os.path.getsize(filepath) == 0:
            return False
        with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
            sig = f.read(8)
            return sig == b'\x89HDF\r\n\x1a\n'
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking file {filepath}: {e}")
        return False

# Your loop for merging worker files
for worker_file in worker_files:
    if not is_valid_hdf5(worker_file):
        print(f"Invalid or corrupted HDF5 file detected: {worker_file}. Skipping or aborting.")
        # Option 1: skip and continue
        # continue

        # Option 2: abort early
        raise RuntimeError(f"Aborting due to invalid HDF5 file: {worker_file}")
    
    with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as h5_in:
        # merge logic here
```

### üîç Diagnosis Recap

- You expected 3000 configs, but only 482 completed (from `monitor.py` output).
- The error only hit at the **final join step**, not during individual optimizations.
- `layouts.h5_temp` contains many suspiciously small (~800 bytes or even 0 bytes) `worker_XXXXX.h5` files.

This suggests that some worker processes either:
- Crashed or timed out before writing data.
- Wrote empty or incomplete files (especially `worker_61817.h5` which is **0 bytes**).

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus: Pre-filter list of files

If you're globbing or iterating over files, you can filter out broken ones like so:

```python
valid_files = [f for f in glob.glob("worker_*.h5") if is_valid_hdf5(f)]
```

Let me know if you'd like help modifying the actual merge code you're using, or automating recovery by re-running only failed seeds.


Awesome. If you're planning to rerun or salvage missing configs, here are a couple of ideas to keep in mind:

---

### üßº Clean Up Zero or Invalid Files

You can clean them up ahead of merging to reduce clutter:

```bash
# Delete all 0-byte files (safe to do)
find layouts.h5_temp -type f -size 0 -name 'worker_*.h5' -delete

# Or log them first:
find layouts.h5_temp -type f -size 0 -name 'worker_*.h5'
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Track Incomplete Work

You already have a nice monitor script (`monitor.py`) that summarizes completed configs. You could extend that to **export a list of missing seeds/farms/types**, and then selectively rerun only those.

For example:

```python
# Pseudocode
expected = set((f, t, s) for f in farms for t in types for s in seeds)
completed = set(counts.keys())
missing = expected - completed
```

Want help building that list automatically?

### üß™ Final Merging Tip

Once the bad files are filtered/skipped, your final merge logic should be much safer. Still, you might want to:

- Log every file that gets merged (especially sizes).
- Keep track of how many datasets/attributes were added from each.
- Optionally save an audit log with a timestamped filename, like `merge_log_YYYYMMDD.txt`.
