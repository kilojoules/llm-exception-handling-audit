The core issue is that the script fails during the final merging of worker files due to an OSError: Unable to synchronously open file (file signature not found). This indicates that one or more of the worker's temporary HDF5 files have become corrupted or are invalid.  

Here's a breakdown of the diagnosis and how to address it:

Diagnosis

    Corrupted Worker Files: The error message file signature not found means that the HDF5 file is not recognized as a valid HDF5 file. This can happen due to various reasons, including:
        Incomplete write operations
        Disk errors
        Premature termination of worker processes
        File system issues
    Intermittent Errors: The fact that the error occurs during the merge phase suggests that the worker processes might be experiencing intermittent issues while writing their temporary files. Some files are written correctly, while others are not.
    Impact: This error prevents the final output file from being created correctly, resulting in the loss of potentially many completed optimizations.

Modifications to Ensure Reliable Error Detection and Clean Stops

To make the script more robust, you can implement these changes:

    Worker File Validation After Writing:
        In the optimize_layout function, after writing to the worker file, add a validation step to ensure the file is written correctly.
        This validation can be as simple as trying to open the file in read mode and read a known dataset ('init'). If this fails, the worker should log an error and return False.
    Python

with h5py.File(worker_file, 'a') as f:
    grp = f.create_group(f"farm{farm_idx}_t{config['type_idx']}_s{config['ss_seed']}")
    grp.create_dataset('layout', data=np.vstack([problem['x'], problem['y']]))
    grp.create_dataset('aep', data=problem.cost) 
    for k, v in config.items():
        grp.attrs[k] = v

# Validate the worker file
try:
    with h5py.File(worker_file, 'r') as f:
        _ = f['init'][()]  # Try to read the 'init' dataset
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Worker {current_process().pid}: Failed to validate worker file: {e}")
    return False

Error Handling in the Main Process:

    In the main function, collect the results from the worker processes and check for any False returns, indicating a failed worker.
    If any worker fails, log a critical error, clean up temporary files, and exit the program. This will prevent attempting to merge potentially corrupted files.

Python

# Run optimizations with progress bar
results = []
for i, result in enumerate(pool.imap_unordered(optimize_partial, configs, chunksize=chunk_size)):
    results.append(result)
    pbar.update(1)

# Check for worker failures
if not all(results):
    logger.critical("One or more worker processes failed. Aborting merge.")
    pool.terminate()  # Ensure all processes are stopped
    pool.join()
    # Clean up temp directory
    for worker_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(temp_dir, "worker_*.h5")):
        os.remove(worker_file)
    os.rmdir(temp_dir)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code

Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:

    Keep the existing logging but ensure that any file-related errors in workers are logged with logger.error.
    The monitor.py script is helpful. Consider adding checks to monitor.py to validate the HDF5 file structure of the worker files directly. If a worker file is detected as invalid, raise an alert.   

Additional Considerations

    Disk Space: Ensure sufficient disk space is available, as running out of space can lead to incomplete file writes.
    File System Health: Investigate the health of the file system being used for temporary files.
    Resource Limits: Check if there are any resource limits (e.g., file handles, memory) that might be affecting the worker processes.
    Retry Mechanism: For transient errors, consider adding a retry mechanism within the worker to re-attempt writing the file a few times before giving up.
