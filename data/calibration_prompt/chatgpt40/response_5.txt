You're doing a solid job here‚Äîthis is a well-thought-out pipeline that integrates PyWake models with Bayesian optimization, time-resolved flow map comparisons, and decent diagnostics. You've clearly put effort into building flexibility in with the MODEL and DOWNWIND logic.

That said, I agree with your assessment: this could benefit from a refactor to improve modularity, clarity, and plotting/reporting structure. Let me address each of your main points and then give you a suggestion for the rewrite structure.
üîç What you're doing right:

    You're correctly mapping PyWake‚Äôs wake model results to your reference deficit data.

    You've modularized the modeling logic based on MODEL and DOWNWIND.

    You're using Bayesian optimization with reasonable priors and defaults.

    Animation and visualization are well-constructed to trace optimization history.

üîÑ What needs refinement or improvement:
1. Flow field plots (RMSE visual diagnostics):

    Current plots are fine but could benefit from summary metrics like:

        Mean and P90 of absolute errors or RMSE.

        Spatial maps of mean error or stddev across time.

    The difference plots are useful but lack standardization (e.g. symmetric color limits for residuals, percentile contours?).

    You‚Äôre reusing flow_map.WS_eff outside of the evaluation loop (this could mismatch with the final WFM outputs).

2. Code structure:

    Logic for instantiating WFM (wind farm model) is duplicated throughout (evaluate_rmse, final eval, etc.)

    The evaluate_rmse is doing too much:

        Building the model

        Running simulations

        Generating predictions

        Comparing with observations

    Rewriting with proper modular structure would be a game-changer.

‚úÖ Suggested Rewrite Plan (high-level modular structure)

Let‚Äôs split the code into logical components:
def create_wfm(model_params: dict, model: int, downwind: bool) -> WindFarmModelResult:

    Encapsulate all logic related to constructing the WFM based on MODEL and DOWNWIND.

    Accept only cleaned params (defaults or from optimizer).

    Returns a fully configured wfm.

def run_simulation(wfm, ws, ti) -> SimulationResult:

    Use consistent site, turbine, and wd.

    Returns sim_res.

def compute_prediction(sim_res, target_x, target_y, time_idx) -> predicted_deficit:

    Uses flow_map.WS_eff to get predicted velocities and compute predicted deficit.

def compute_error(predicted_deficit, observed_deficit) -> float or xr.DataArray:

    Flexible to return RMSE, MAE, or spatial error maps.

    Can also include p90, mean, max, etc.

def evaluate_rmse(**kwargs) -> float:

    Just orchestration of the above steps.

    Keeps the objective function tight and focused.

def plot_flow_error(pred, obs, diff, time_idx):

    More standardized plotting, clean subplots.

    Add optional p90/mean error overlay.

üß† About changing flow_map.WS_eff vs reference deficit

You're on point here:

    flow_map.WS_eff is absolute velocity, while flow_roi.deficits is deficit.

So when comparing, your derived pred = (WS - WS_eff)/WS is correct and elegant‚Äîthis normalizes into a deficit prediction. You just want to make sure you're doing this with the correct flow_map output, ideally recomputed after model changes.

To reduce ambiguity:

    Add a helper def compute_deficit_from_ws(ws_eff, ws_freestream): to clarify this step.

‚ú® Additional Suggestions:

    Add a toggle to use different error metrics (rmse, mae, p90_abs_err) for evaluation.

    Log results (params + metrics) to CSV or DataFrame for post-analysis.

    Optional: move plotting outside of main script into a small dashboard/report generator.

    Think about caching flow maps or simulations for speed‚Äîyour re-runs could be expensive.

‚úÖ Next Step?

Would you like me to sketch out the rewritten modular version of the evaluate_rmse and model instantiation parts? That‚Äôd be a great starting point, and we can layer in plotting changes after that.

Let me know how modular or "production-ready" you want it to be.

Great! Here's a clean modular rewrite of the key parts of your code: instantiating the model, running simulations, computing deficits, and evaluating RMSE. This version separates responsibilities, reduces duplication, and sets you up to plug in plotting/reporting cleanly.
üì¶ 1. Model Instantiation (create_wfm)

def create_wfm(params: dict, model: int, downwind: bool):
    from py_wake.superposition_models import LinearSum
    from py_wake.turbulence_models import CrespoHernandez
    from py_wake.deficit_models.gaussian import TurboGaussianDeficit, BlondelSuperGaussianDeficit2020
    from py_wake.deficit_models import SelfSimilarityDeficit2020
    from py_wake.ground_models import Mirror
    from py_wake.rotor_avg_models.gaussian_overlap_model import GaussianOverlapAvgModel

    # Required shared inputs
    turbine = DTU10MW()
    site = Hornsrev1Site()

    if downwind:
        if model == 1:
            wake_deficitModel = BlondelSuperGaussianDeficit2020(
                a_s=params['a_s'], b_s=params['b_s'], c_s=params['c_s'],
                b_f=params['b_f'], c_f=params['c_f']
            )
        else:
            wake_deficitModel = TurboGaussianDeficit(
                A=params['A'],
                cTI=[params['cti1'], params['cti2']],
                ctlim=params['ctlim'],
                ceps=params['ceps'],
                ct2a=ct2a_mom1d,
                groundModel=Mirror(),
                rotorAvgModel=GaussianOverlapAvgModel()
            )
            wake_deficitModel.WS_key = 'WS_jlk'

        turbulenceModel = CrespoHernandez(c=np.array([
            params['ch1'], params['ch2'], params['ch3'], params['ch4']
        ]))
        blockage_deficitModel = SelfSimilarityDeficit2020()  # Placeholder (non-downwind doesn't use it?)

    else:
        wake_deficitModel = BlondelSuperGaussianDeficit2020()
        turbulenceModel = CrespoHernandez()  # No params
        blockage_deficitModel = SelfSimilarityDeficit2020(
            ss_alpha=params['ss_alpha'], ss_beta=params['ss_beta'],
            r12p=np.array([params['rp1'], params['rp2']]),
            ngp=np.array([params['ng1'], params['ng2'], params['ng3'], params['ng4']]),
            groundModel=Mirror() if model == 2 else None
        )

    wfm = All2AllIterative(
        site=site,
        windTurbines=turbine,
        wake_deficitModel=wake_deficitModel,
        superpositionModel=LinearSum(),
        deflectionModel=None,
        turbulenceModel=turbulenceModel,
        blockage_deficitModel=blockage_deficitModel
    )
    return wfm

üöÄ 2. Simulation Runner

def run_simulation(wfm, ws, ti, wd=270):
    return wfm([0], [0], ws=ws, TI=ti, wd=[wd]*len(ws), time=True)

üìâ 3. Deficit Prediction Extractor

def compute_predicted_deficit(sim_res, x_coords, y_coords, time_index):
    flow_map = sim_res.flow_map(HorizontalGrid(x=x_coords, y=y_coords), time=[time_index])
    ws_eff = flow_map.WS_eff.isel(h=0)
    freestream_ws = sim_res.WS[time_index]
    deficit = (freestream_ws - ws_eff) / freestream_ws
    return deficit

üìè 4. Error Calculation

def compute_rmse(observed_deficit, predicted_deficit):
    diff = observed_deficit - predicted_deficit
    return float(np.sqrt((diff**2).mean()))

üß™ 5. RMSE Evaluator (Objective Function)

def evaluate_rmse_modular(**params):
    try:
        wfm = create_wfm(params, model=MODEL, downwind=DOWNWIND)
        sim_res = run_simulation(wfm, full_ws, full_ti)

        all_pred = []
        for t in range(len(full_ws)):
            pred_deficit = compute_predicted_deficit(sim_res, target_x, target_y, time_index=t)
            all_pred.append(pred_deficit)
        
        pred_stack = xr.concat(all_pred, dim='time')
        rmse = compute_rmse(all_obs, pred_stack)
        
        return -rmse if not np.isnan(rmse) else -0.5
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Eval error: {e}")
        return -0.5

üéØ What's next?

With this modular base in place, we can:

    Plug it back into the BayesianOptimization(...) call

    Clean up the reporting and plots (update_plot, plot_flow_error, etc.)

    Add advanced summaries like p90, mean error maps, or time-aggregated RMSEs

Would you like the plotting part modularized next? I can help structure a plot reporting function that includes:

    Contour maps

    RMSE per time step

    Optional percentiles or error thresholds

Or do you want to first plug in this modular evaluation function into your optimizer and test it?
